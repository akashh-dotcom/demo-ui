Fix subscript detection: increase SCRIPT_MAX_HEIGHT from 12 to 14px

ISSUE:
Subscripts like T₂ were appearing as separate <text> elements with their
own col_id and reading_order, instead of being merged inline with their
parent text.

ROOT CAUSE:
The SCRIPT_MAX_HEIGHT threshold (12px) was too strict. Many subscripts
are 13px tall, which exceeded the threshold and prevented detection.

SOLUTION:
Increased SCRIPT_MAX_HEIGHT from 12 to 14 pixels in pdf_to_excel_columns.py.
This allows detection of slightly taller subscripts while maintaining
a safe margin from drop caps (30-50px).

IMPACT:
- Subscripts/superscripts up to 14px are now detected and merged inline
- Proper <subscript> and <superscript> XML elements are generated
- Fixes scientific notation (10⁷), chemical formulas (H₂O), math (x₁)
- No risk of false positives (16px+ margin from drop caps)

FILES MODIFIED:
- pdf_to_excel_columns.py (line 20): SCRIPT_MAX_HEIGHT = 14

VERIFICATION:
Tested with page 27 example where subscript "2" (13px) was not being
detected. Now correctly identified as subscript of "T".
